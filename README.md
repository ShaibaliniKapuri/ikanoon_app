# Legal Chat Application

A simple legal chat-based application where users can search for legal cases and interact with an LLM (Large Language Model) to gain insights about the searched cases. The application integrates multiple technologies for seamless functionality, including backend APIs, knowledge graphs, and a basic frontend interface.

## Features
- **Search Legal Cases**: Uses the Ikanoon API to fetch details of legal cases.
- **Chat with LLM**: Leverages the Groq API to facilitate conversations with an LLM about the searched legal cases.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Generates a knowledge graph using LLama Index from the searched case and queries the graph to answer user questions.
- **Database Support**: Powered by PostgreSQL with Apache AGE for graph database functionality.
- **Frontend**: A minimalistic interface built with Vue.js CDN.

---

## Prerequisites
To set up the project, you need the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL with Apache AGE extension
- Groq API key (for LLM integration)
- Ikanoon API key (for legal case search)

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your `.env` file with the following keys:
   ```plaintext
   IKANOON_API_KEY=<your-ikanoon-api-key>
   GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
   DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
   ```

4. Initialize the PostgreSQL database with Apache AGE:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database.
   - Load the Apache AGE extension.
   - Configure the database connection in your application.

5. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open the `index.html` in the `templates/` directory to view the frontend in a browser.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - Ikanoon API (Legal case search)
  - Groq API (LLM chat)
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL with Apache AGE (Graph database support)
- **Frontend**:
  - Vue.js CDN (Minimal interface)
- **Knowledge Graph**:
  - LLama Index (Graph generation and querying)

---

## Usage
1. Search for a legal case using keywords in the application.
2. Select a case from the results.
3. Chat with the LLM about the selected case to get deeper insights or clarifications.

---

## Limitations
- **Frontend**: Currently, the UI/UX is basic and not optimized for a production-ready environment.
- **Search Scope**: Limited by the data available via the Ikanoon API.
- **Performance**: Knowledge graph generation can take time for large cases.
